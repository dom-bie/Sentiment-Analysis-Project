# Sentiment Analysis Project

This program can be used as a Natural Language Processing tool. It allows you to analyze your text in many different ways. Its primary function is to conduct sentiment analysis. Apart from that, there are other options available, such as providing a list of positive and negative words, a frequency list, or a list of kewyords for your text data. You can also use it as a NER, use it for tagging, and more.
